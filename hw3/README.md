### Error Handling
Value Invalid  
If the value is text or NULL, an error message, "Invalid value!," will appear under the offending box(es).  

Value Out of Bounds  
If the value is too large or small, it is clamped to a maximum of 64 or a minimum of -64.  

Positive & Negative  
Values can be either positive or negative.  

Table Too Large  
The table always fits within the main area of the page. The user is presented with scrollbars to navigate the table when necessary.  

Axis Ordering  
Axes can be ordered from greatest to least or least to greatest, it works either way.
