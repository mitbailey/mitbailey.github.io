            <p>Project Spaceship is an arcade-style game where the player controls a single blue spaceship and attempts
                to survive waves of enemy spacecraft. Similar to the well-known Asteroids, the player can rotate and
                fire their engines in a single direction, continuing to move as if in a frictionless vacuum. Enemies fly
                in from the edges of the screen and are introduced in increasing numbers and difficulty each level. If
                the player flies off the screen they reappear on the opposite side, while enemy ships will have to turn
                around and fly back onto the screen. </p>

        <!-- This section lists the features of the game as an unordered list. -->
        <div class="written_section">
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>Hull Strength and Shields</b></i>. The miniature player-ships and blue arcs symbols in
                    the top left corner represent the player-ship's hull strength and shields respectively. Shields will
                    regenerate slowly over time if not hit by enemy fire, however hull strength can never be regained.
                    Hull
                    strength will not decrease until shields are disabled. The player-ship explodes if hull strength
                    reaches
                    zero.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>Newtonian Physics</b></i>. The game follows <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion#Newton's_first_law">Newton's first
                        law
                        of motion</a>. Since the only force exterted on the player-ship is that of the engines, it will
                    continue at a constant velocity until the engines are fired again. Enemy ships and all weapons-fire
                    also follow this principle.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>Endless Levels</b></i>. There are 20 unique levels of increasing difficulty. Beyond level 20
                    no new enemy types are introduced, however the game continues to introduce an increasing number of
                    enemies each level for an infinite number of levels.</li>
            </ul>
