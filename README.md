# mitbailey.github.io

This website is developed using Visual Studio Code in HTML and CSS. It was started as a project for my (web) GUI Programming I class, but will eventually act as my main site. It is based on my current site mitbailey.com, which was made using Google Sites. 

The general idea is for this site to function as a central location from which to view a summary of my work and to find links to directly access my work and view my profiles.
